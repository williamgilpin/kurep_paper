## Kuramoto model with repulsion

Source code available in `oscillators.py`

### Dependencies

+ Python 3
+ matplotlib
+ numpy
+ numba
+ jupyter notebooks (for demo notebooks)

Note: the easiest way to install numba is as part of Anaconda or Miniconda. Currently, numba is needed to make the code run efficiently and portably.

### Usage

See the minimal working example shown in `example.ipynb`

### Development

This code will be kept mostly unchanged, see my working repository [oscy](https://github.com/williamgilpin/oscy) for the in-progress sofware package upon which this repo is based.
